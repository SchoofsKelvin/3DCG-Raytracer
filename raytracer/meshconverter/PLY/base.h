Header for PLY polygon files.

- Greg Turk

A PLY file contains a single polygonal _object_.

An object is composed of lists of _elements_.  Typical elements are
vertices, faces, edges and materials.

Each type of element for a given object has one or more _properties_
associated with the element type.  For instance, a vertex element may
have as properties three floating-point values x,y,z and three unsigned
chars for red, green and blue.

/** \mainpage
 *
 *  \section overview Overview
 *
 *  This project provides a simple, but general,
 *  implementation of a reader and writer for
 *  streams using the ply format. It has the
 *  following features:
 *
 *  - The streams are generally file-streams, but
 *  it is very simple to replace these by any other
 *  stream, such as the standard in/output stream
 *  (i.e. std::cout, std::cin).
 *  - The implementation is general in that it can
 *  read and write any file in ply format,
 *  irrespective of the actual elements used.
 *  The required data is stored by letting the user
 *  construct their own subclasses for Object and
 *  Storage. Examples are provided in the form of
 *  the Vertex, Face and Mesh classes.
 *  - Very easy to use.
 *  - The reader automatically parses the header.
 *  After this, it is very easy to check which of
 *  your own Object subclasses match.
 *  - All the values are passed through the code as
 *  double, making it easier to handle them.
 *  - Possible to easily change the way faults
 *  while reading/writing the files are handled
 *  (e.g. stop processing, or just an error message).
 *  - Correctly handles each type of stream (i.e.
 *  ASCII, little-endian, or big-endian).
 *  - Can process the data very fast and with small
 *  memory usage.
 *  - Platform independent due to restriction to
 *  ANSI C and standard template libraries. Similarly,
 *  both "\n" and "\r\n" line ending are handled.
 *
 * \subsection discl Disclaimer
 *
 *  The code is based upon Greg Turk's code from 1998.
 *  I have written the complete project from scratch
 *  and the interface is very different to Turk's code.
 *  However, the underlying code ended up very similar
 *  to the original, so I feel I should give proper
 *  credit here.
 *
 *  Any parts that are significantly different, such
 *  as the usage of streams, may be used under the
 *  GPL 3.0 license.
 *
 *  Thank you for using this free code. May your data
 *  storage be smooth and safe.
 *
 *  Thijs van Lankveld
