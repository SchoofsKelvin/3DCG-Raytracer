Header for PLY polygon files.

- Greg Turk

A PLY file contains a single polygonal _object_.

An object is composed of lists of _elements_.  Typical elements are
vertices, faces, edges and materials.

Each type of element for a given object has one or more _properties_
associated with the element type.  For instance, a vertex element may
have as properties three floating-point values x,y,z and three unsigned
chars for red, green and blue.
